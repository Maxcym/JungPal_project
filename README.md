# JungPal Project

# Resume of our project

The aim of this project is to create a platform that will allow to solve the accomodation problem in Pfarrkirchen. In fact, the number of accommodation is not enough compared to the number of students who want to study at the European Campus. Moreover, by reading many articles about the loneliness of elderly people in Germany, we noticed that in most  cases these people were alone. To solve these problems, we decided to create a website that would allow students to live among ederly people. Thanks to this, students will be able to find a place to live and at the same time bring companionship to these people.
