# JungPal Project

# Resume of our project

The aim of this project is to create a platform to solve the accommodation problem in Pfarrkirchen. In fact, there is not enough accommodation compared to the number of students who want to study at the European Campus. Furthermore, after reading many articles about the loneliness of elderly people in Germany, we noticed that in most cases these people were alone. To solve these problems, we decided to create a website that would allow students to live among elderly people. Thanks to this, students will be able to find a place to live and at the same time bring companionship to these people.

# Key Features

**Account Creation and Authentication:** A secure system for account creation and authentication for both students and elderly individuals. This ensures that only verified users can access the platform and benefit from its features.

**Profile Management:** Both students and elderly individuals can create and manage detailed profiles.

**Communication Tools:** Integrated messaging functionalities to facilitate communication between students and potential elderly housemates. This helps in building trust and understanding before finalizing any living arrangements.

**Feedback and Rating System:** A feedback and rating system for both students and elderly individuals to share their experiences. This feature ensures transparency and helps future users make informed decisions.

# Technical Overview

The platform incorporates both front-end and back-end technologies to provide a user-friendly interface and support complex functionalities:

**Front-end:** Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the front-end ensures a very simple and easy-to-use interface for elderly individuals.

**Back-end:** 

**Database and Server:** The platform utilizes AWS (Amazon Web Services) for the server infrastructure. AWS provides a reliable, scalable, and secure environment for hosting the platform.
