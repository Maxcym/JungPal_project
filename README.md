# JungPal Project

# Resume of our project

The aim of this project is to create a platform to solve the accommodation problem in Pfarrkirchen. In fact, there is not enough accommodation compared to the number of students who want to study at the European Campus. Furthermore, after reading many articles about the loneliness of elderly people in Germany, we noticed that in most cases these people were alone. To solve these problems, we decided to create a website that would allow students to live among elderly people. Thanks to this, students will be able to find a place to live and at the same time bring companionship to these people.

# Key Features

- **Account Creation and Authentication:** a secure system for account creation and authentication for both students and elderly individuals. This ensures that only verified users can access the platform and benefit from its features.

- **Profile Management:** both students and elderly individuals can create and manage detailed profiles.

- **Communication Tools:** a chatbox will be developed to facilitate communication between students and potential elderly housemates. This chatbox will allow students to find apartments according to their criteria, with an algorithm guiding their search. It will also enable elderly individuals to contact students directly.

- **Advertisement Management:** elderly individuals can now create, edit, and delete accommodation listings, making it easier for them to manage their housing offers.

# Technical Overview

The platform incorporates both front-end and back-end technologies to provide a user-friendly interface and support complex functionalities:

**Front-end:** 

- **Technologies:** developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the front-end ensures a simple and intuitive interface for elderly people. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it to create a visually appealing and accessible design, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic features.

- **User interface (UI)**: the UI is designed with accessibility in mind, using large fonts, high-contrast colors, and simple navigation menus to cater to elderly users. Forms and buttons are designed to be easily clickable, and the layout is responsive to work well on various screens.

**Back-end:** 

- **Database and Server:** the platform uses a local database for data storage. This approach provides direct and personalized management of data, ensuring high performance and security.

- **Technologies:** the back-end is built using PHP and JavaScript. PHP is utilized for server-side scripting, allowing us to handle form submissions, manage sessions, and interact with the database. JavaScript is employed for creating dynamic and interactive features that enhance the user experience.

- **Server:** in the future, a server on AWS will be set up to enhance scalability and reliability.
